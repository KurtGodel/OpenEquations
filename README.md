# OpenEquations
A Free and Open Source Equation Editor

While technically a Cocoa application, this app is really just a wrapper for the "EquationField" class, which will allow users to edit equations using an intuitive, WYSIWYG interface. The goals are:

1. allow users to create elegant equations
2. make the classes portable to other applications (esp OpenCalc)
3. make editing equations as painless ass possible
4. allow exporting of equations by
  1. copying the equation's LaTex code into clipboard
  2. saving the equation as an image
