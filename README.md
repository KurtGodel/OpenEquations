# OpenEquations
A Free and Open Source Equation Editor

While technically a Cocoa application, this app is really just a wrapper for the "EquationField" class, which will allow users to edit equations using an intuitive, WYSIWYG interface. Ultimately, this is being created with the intention of being used in OpenCalc, but feel free to use it in your own projects.

The current features include:

1. logarithms with custom bases
2. superscripts
3. summations
4. integrals
5. fractions
6. exporting as LaTeX
7. exporting as a .png file
8. undo/redo
9. No known glitches

The current agenda for improvements include:

1. highlighting
2. deleting equation components (note: you can already "undo", delete the entire equation, and delete characters)
